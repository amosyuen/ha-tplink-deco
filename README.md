## Functionality

This integration is a local polling integration that logs into the admin web UI for TP-Link Deco routers. Currently the only feature implemented is device trackers for active devices.

### Device Trackers

Besides the device being present (connected to the router), the following attributes are also exposed:

| Attribute            | Example Values (comma separated) |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| mac                  | 1A-B2-C3-4D-56-EF                |
| ip_address           | 192.168.0.100                    |
| connection_type      | band5, band2_4                   |
| interface            | main, guest                      |
| down_kilobytes_per_s | 100                              |
| up_kilobytes_per_s   | 100                              |
| deco_device          | living_room                      |

## Installation

### HACS

1. Install [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/)
2. Go to HACS "Integrations >" section
3. In the lower right click "+ Explore & Download repositories"
4. Search for "TP-Link Deco" and add it
   - HA Restart is not needed since it is configured in UI config flow
5. In the Home Assistant (HA) UI go to "Configuration"
6. Click "Integrations"
7. Click "+ Add Integration"
8. Search for "TP-Link Deco"

### Manual

1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your [HA configuration](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/) (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
2. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
3. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `tplink_deco`.
4. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/tplink_deco/` directory (folder) in this repository.
5. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
6. Restart Home Assistant
7. In the Home Assistant (HA) UI go to "Configuration"
8. Click "Integrations"
9. Click "+ Add Integration"
10. Search for "TP-Link Deco"

{% endif %}

## Configuration (Important! Please Read)

Config is done in the HA integrations UI.

The login credentials must be the deco **owner** credentials and the username should be left as **admin**. Manager credentials will not work. Also when this integration is logged in, all other sessions for the owner will be logged out. Recommend that you create a separate manager account with full permissions to manage the router manually and use the owner credentials only for this integration.

### Disable new entities

If you prefer new entities to be disabled by default:

1. In the Home Assistant (HA) UI go to "Configuration"
2. Click "Integrations"
3. Click the three dots in the bottom right corner fo the TP-Link Deco integration
4. Click "System options"
5. Disable "Enable newly added entities"
